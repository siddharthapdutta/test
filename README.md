--------Interview Stage 1--------
create a new table in postgres and load this CSV that denotes the mapping between pincode and lat/long (https://github.com/sanand0/pincode/blob/master/data/IN.csv).
Create Two APIs  : Get,Post.
Post api - /post_location : Post lat,lng of any location with pin code+address+city. This api will add new pin code in db.  
IMPORTANT: Remember to check if pin code already exists or if there are existing latitude+longitude THAT ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE THE SAME (dont assume that they will exactly be the same.)
 
Get api - /get_location : Given lat,lng ... it will fetch pin code, address, city as a json response.
 
Write testcases using pytest.
